Blastoids Source

WELCOME
	I appologize for the source being so horrible to read.  All game content and gameplay is held in the top-most .cpp and .h files while the game engine (aka Lucid) is held in the Lucid directory.  Lucid was also written by me.  If you feel that you could use Lucid for your own use to make a game, feel free to do so, just make sure you put me somewhere in the credits!  If you have any questions regarding the source, give me a shout.  To compile, you'll need to link to zlib, libPNG, libJPEG, FMOD, SDL, SDL_image and SDL_ttf.  I have done this already in the Dev-C++ project.

	Good luck looking through the source.... You'll need it!
